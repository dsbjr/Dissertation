The second edition, published in 1996, incorporated three comprehensive chapters on phase transitions and critical phenomena. This third edition includes new sections on Bose-Einstein condensation and degenerate Fermi behavior of ultracold atomic gases, and two new chapters on computer simulation methods and the thermodynamics of the early universe. We have also added new sections on chemical and phase equilibrium, and expanded our discussions of correlations and scattering, quantized fields, finite-size effects and the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. We hope this new edition will continue to provide new generations of students with a solid training in the methods of statistical physics.-Bose-Einstein condensation in atomic gases -Thermodynamics of the early universe -Computer simulations: Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics -Correlation functions and scattering -Fluctuation-dissipation theorem and the dynamical structure factor -Chemical equilibrium -Exact solution of the two-dimensional Ising model for finite systems -Degenerate atomic Fermi gases -Exact solutions of one-dimensional fluid models -Interactions in ultracold Bose and Fermi gases -Brownian motion of anisotropic particles and harmonic oscillators},

abstract = {We perform Raman spectroscopy studies on {\$}\backslashalpha{\$}-RuCl{\$}{\_}3{\$} at room temperature to explore its phase transitions of magnetism and chemical bonding under pressures. The Raman measurements resolve two critical pressures, about {\$}p{\_}1=1.1{\$}{\~{}}GPa and {\$}p{\_}2=1.7{\$}{\~{}}GPa, involving very different intertwining behaviors between the structural and magnetic excitations. With increasing pressures, a stacking order phase transition of {\$}\backslashalpha{\$}-RuCl{\$}{\_}3{\$} layers develops at {\$}p{\_}1=1.1{\$}{\~{}}GPa, indicated by the new Raman phonon modes and the modest Raman magnetic susceptibility adjustment. The abnormal softening and splitting of the Ru in-plane Raman mode provide direct evidence of the in-plane dimerization of the Ru-Ru bonds at {\$}p{\_}2=1.7{\$}{\~{}}GPa. The Raman susceptibility is greatly enhanced with pressure increasing and sharply suppressed after the dimerization. We propose that the system undergoes Mott collapse at {\$}p{\_}2=1.7{\$}{\~{}}GPa and turns into a dimerized correlated band insulator. Our studies demonstrate competitions between Kitaev physics, magnetism, and chemical bondings in Kitaev compounds.},

@article{Mashhadi2018,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 American Chemical Society. The small gap semiconductor $\alpha$-RuCl 3 has emerged as a promising candidate for quantum spin liquid materials. Thus far, Raman spectroscopy, neutron scattering, and magnetization measurements have provided valuable hints for collective spin behavior in $\alpha$-RuCl 3 bulk crystals. However, the goal of implementing $\alpha$-RuCl 3 into spintronic devices would strongly benefit from the possibility of electrically probing these phenomena. To address this, we first investigated nanoflakes of $\alpha$-RuCl 3 by Raman spectroscopy and observed similar behavior as in the case of the bulk material, including the signatures of possible fractionalized excitations. In complementary experiments, we investigated the electrical charge transport properties of individual $\alpha$-RuCl 3 nanoflakes in the temperature range between 120 and 290 K. The observed temperature-dependent electrical resistivity is consistent with variable range hopping behavior and exhibits a transition at about 180 K, close to the onset temperature observed in our Raman measurements. In conjunction with the established relation between structure and magnetism in the bulk, we interpret this transition to coincide with the emergence of fractionalized excitations due to the Kitaev interactions in the nanoflakes. Compared to the bulk samples, the transition temperature of the underlying structural change is larger in the nanoflakes. This difference is tentatively attributed to the dimensionality of the nanoflakes as well as the formation of stacking faults during mechanical exfoliation. The demonstrated devices open up novel perspectives toward manipulating the Kitaev-phase in $\alpha$-RuCl 3 via electrical means.},
annote = {TRANSPORT, RAMAN

Transport on thin flakes of RuCl3 shows VRH with a separate low temperature and high temperature regime, with T0 corresponding to about 50 and about 130 meV respectively. Suggest transition occurs as a result of structural transition. VRH power law dependence confirms 2D nature of flakes.

Their minimum flake thickness is 10 nm.

Raman spectra measured for a bulk and a 10 nm flake are equivalent.

Equations in this paper suggest using fits to the VRH model to learn about the density of states at the fermi level.

Paper suggests Ar milling contact area improves contact resistance.},

@article{Glamazda2017,
abstract = {Raman scattering has been employed to investigate lattice and magnetic excitations of the honeycomb Kitaev material $\alpha$-RuCl 3 and its Heisenberg counterpart CrCl 3 . Our phonon Raman spectra give evidence for a first-order structural transition from a monoclinic to a rhombohedral structure for both compounds. Significantly, only $\alpha$-RuCl 3 features a large thermal hysteresis, consistent with the formation of a wide phase of coexistence. In the related temperature interval of 70–170 K, we observe a hysteretic behavior of magnetic excitations as well. The stronger magnetic response in the rhombohedral compared to the monoclinic phase evidences a coupling between the crystallographic structure and low-energy magnetic response. Our results demonstrate that the Kitaev magnetism concomitant with fractionalized excitations is susceptible to small variations of bonding geometry.},

Investigation into structural transition as a function of temperature by comparing with CrCl3, which should be similar. They find a large window (hysteresis) where a first-order structural transition occurs (monoclinic to rhombohedral). The rhombohedral structure seems to support Kitaev magnetism better.},

@article{Sandilands2016,
abstract = {Mott insulators with strong spin-orbit coupling have been proposed to host unconventional magnetic states, including the Kitaev quantum spin liquid. The 4d system $\alpha$-RuCl 3 has recently come into view as a candidate Kitaev system, with evidence for unusual spin excitations in magnetic scattering experiments. We apply a combination of optical spectroscopy and Raman scattering to study the electronic structure of this material. Our measurements reveal a series of orbital excitations involving localized total angular momentum states of the Ru ion, implying that strong spin-orbit coupling and electron-electron interactions coexist in this material. Analysis of these features allows us to estimate the spin-orbit coupling strength, as well as other parameters describing the local electronic structure, revealing a well-defined hierarchy of energy scales within the Ru d states. By comparing our experimental results with density functional theory calculations, we also clarify the overall features of the optical response. Our results demonstrate that $\alpha$-RuCl 3 is an ideal material system to study spin-orbit coupled magnetism on the honeycomb lattice.},

@article{Siddharthan2001,
abstract = {We take another look at two compounds which have been discussed as possible realizations of "spin ice," namely holmium titanate and dysprosium titanate. As we have earlier observed, holmium titanate does not display icelike behavior at low temperatures because the long-ranged dipolar interactions between spins are strong compared to the nearest-neighbor interactions. We show, exactly, that the true around state of this system must be fully ordered, but simulations only reach partially ordered states because there are infinite energy barriers separating these from the true ground state. We also show that the true ground state of our model of dysprosium titanate is also fully ordered, and offer some explanations as to why simulations and experiments show icelike behavior. We discuss the effect on these systems of an applied magnetic field. Finally, we discuss several other models which show similar partial or full ordering in their ground states, including the well-known Ising model on the fee lattice.},
