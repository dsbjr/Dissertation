abstract="The exact diagonalization method is a high accuracy numerical approach for solving the Hubbard model of a system of electrons with strong correlation. The method solves for the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Hamiltonian matrix derived from the Hubbard model. Since the Hamiltonian is a huge sparse symmetric matrix, it was expected that the LOBPCG method with an appropriate preconditioner could be used to solve the problem in a short time. This turned out to be the case as the LOBPCG method with a suitable preconditioner succeeded in solving the ground state (the smallest eigenvalue and its corresponding eigenvector) of the Hamiltonian. In order to solve for multiple eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian in a short time, we use a preconditioner based on the Neumann expansion which uses approximate eigenvalues and eigenvectors given by LOBPCG iteration. We apply a communication avoiding strategy, which was developed considering the physical properties of the Hubbard model, to the preconditioner. Our numerical experiments on two parallel computers show that the LOBPCG method coupled with the Neumann preconditioner and the communication avoiding strategy improves convergence and achieves excellent scalability when solving for multiple eigenvalues.",

Here we study the electronic structure of $\alpha$-RuCl3, in which the Ru ions are in a d5 configuration and form a honeycomb lattice, by angle-resolved photoemission, x-ray photoemission, and electron energy loss spectroscopy supported by density functional theory and multiplet calculations. We find that $\alpha$-RuCl3 is a Mott insulator with significant spin-orbit coupling, whose low energy electronic structure is naturally mapped onto Jeff states.

@article{Sinn2016,
abstract = {Recently, $\alpha$-RuCl3 has attracted much attention as a possible material to realize the honeycomb Kitaev model of a quantum-spin-liquid state. Although the magnetic properties of $\alpha$-RuCl3 have been extensively studied, its electronic structure, which is strongly related to its Kitaev physics, is poorly understood. Here, the electronic structure of $\alpha$-RuCl3 was investigated by photoemission (PE) and inverse-photoemission (IPE) spectroscopies. The band gap was directly measured from the PE and IPE spectra and was found to be 1.9 eV, much larger than previously estimated values. Local density approximation (LDA) calculations showed that the on-site Coulomb interaction U could open the band gap without spin-orbit coupling (SOC). However, the SOC should also be incorporated to reproduce the proper gap size, indicating that the interplay between U and SOC plays an essential role. Several features of the PE and IPE spectra could not be explained by the results of LDA calculations. To explain such discrepancies, we performed configuration-interaction calculations for a RuCl6 3- cluster. The experimental data and calculations demonstrated that the 4d compound $\alpha$-RuCl3 is a Jeff = 1/2 Mott insulator rather than a quasimolecular-orbital insulator. Our study also provides important physical parameters required for verifying the proposed Kitaev physics in $\alpha$-RuCl3. {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2016.},

Here we report a comprehensive, atomically resolved real-space study by scanning transmission electron and scanning tunnelling microscopies on a novel layered material displaying Kitaev physics, a-RuCl 3 . Our local crystallography analysis reveals considerable variations in the geometry of the ligand sublattice in thin films of a-RuCl 3 that opens a way to realization of a spatially inhomogeneous magnetic ground state at the nanometre length scale. Using scanning tunnelling techniques, we observe the electronic energy gap of E0.25 eV and intra-unit cell symmetry breaking of charge distribution in individual a-RuCl 3 surface layer.

@article{Banerjee2016,
abstract = {Quantum spin liquids (QSLs) are topological states of matter exhibiting remarkable properties such as the capacity to protect quantum information from decoherence. Whereas their featureless ground states have precluded their straightforward experimental identification, excited states are more revealing and particularly interesting owing to the emergence of fundamentally new excitations such as Majorana fermions. Ideal probes of these excitations are inelastic neutron scattering experiments. These we report here for a ruthenium-based material, [alpha]-RuCl3, continuing a major search (so far concentrated on iridium materials) for realizations of the celebrated Kitaev honeycomb topological QSL. Our measurements confirm the requisite strong spin-orbit coupling and low-temperature magnetic order matching predictions proximate to the QSL. We find stacking faults, inherent to the highly two-dimensional nature of the material, resolve an outstanding puzzle. Crucially, dynamical response measurements above interlayer energy scales are naturally accounted for in terms of deconfinement physics expected for QSLs. Comparing these with recent dynamical calculations involving gauge flux excitations and Majorana fermions of the pure Kitaev model, we propose the excitation spectrum of [alpha]-RuCl3 as a prime candidate for fractionalized Kitaev physics.},

@article{Han2012,
abstract = {New physics can emerge in magnetic materials where quantum fluctuations are enhanced due to reduced dimensionality and strong frustration. One long sought example is the resonating-valence-bond (RVB) state, where atomic magnetic moments are strongly correlated but do not order or freeze even in the limit of T -{\textgreater} 0. The RVB ground state does not break conventional symmetries, such as lattice translation or spin-rotation. The realization of such a quantum spin liquid in two-dimensions would represent a new state of matter. It is believed that spin liquid physics plays a role in the phenomenon of high-Tc superconductivity, and the topological properties of the spin liquid state may have applications in the field of quantum information. We present neutron scattering measurements of the spin excitations on single crystal samples of the spin-1/2 kagom$\backslash$'{\{}e{\}} lattice antiferromagnet ZnCu3(OD)6Cl2 (also called herbertsmithite).

The topological phase is naturally connected to the {\$}\backslashmathbb{\{}Z{\}}{\_}2{\$} gauge symmetry of the local tensor.

We also point out strong similarities between our phase diagram and the one of a classical interacting dimer model suggesting that both can be described by the same long-wavelength field theory. Incidentally, the entanglement spectrum is found to be gapped in the {\$}\backslashmathbb{\{}Z{\}}{\_}2{\$} phase.},

However, by precise measure-ment with electrical resistivity or impedance and differential scanning calorimetry, we show clear evidence for the first-order nature of these " second-order transitions " —a small thermal hysteresis and latent heat. Such first-order signatures are found to be the same as those for the well-recognized first-order transitions in the ferroelectric BaTiO 3 and ferroelastic Ti 50 Ni 47 Fe 3 . These results question the existence of genuine second-order transition in ferromagnetic systems. By a phenomenological approach, we further show that the first-order nature of ferromagnetic transition may stem from a coupling of magnetic moment to other order parameter͑s͒ like strain. Such a coupling may provide insight into developing highly magnetoresponsive materials.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 American Physical Society. Single crystals of the Kitaev spin-liquid candidate $\alpha$-RuCl3 have been studied to determine the low-temperature bulk properties, the structure, and the magnetic ground state. Refinements of x-ray diffraction data show that the low-temperature crystal structure is described by space group C2/m with a nearly perfect honeycomb lattice exhibiting less than 0.2{\%} in-plane distortion. The as-grown single crystals exhibit only one sharp magnetic transition at TN=7 K. The magnetic order below this temperature exhibits a propagation vector of k=(0,1,1/3), which coincides with a three-layer stacking of the C2/m unit cells. Magnetic transitions at higher temperatures up to 14 K can be introduced by deformations of the crystal that result in regions in the crystal with a two-layer stacking sequence. The best-fit symmetry-allowed magnetic structure of the as-grown crystals shows that the spins lie in the ac plane, with a zigzag configuration in each honeycomb layer. The three-layer repeat out-of-plane structure can be refined as a 120° spiral order or a collinear structure with a spin direction of 35° away from the a axis. The collinear spin configuration yields a slightly better fit and also is physically preferred. The average ordered moment in either structure is less than 0.45(5) $\mu$B per Ru3+ ion.},

abstract = { This work demonstrates an elegant way to synthesize $\alpha$-RuCl 3 nanosheets down to the monolayer limit by chemical vapor transport and subsequent delamination techniques.  The 2D layered honeycomb magnet $\alpha$-ruthenium( iii ) chloride ($\alpha$-RuCl 3 ) is a promising candidate to realize a Kitaev spin model. As alteration of physical properties on the nanoscale is additionally intended, new synthesis approaches to obtain phase pure $\alpha$-RuCl 3 nanocrystals have been audited. Thermodynamic simulations of occurring gas phase equilibria were performed and optimization of synthesis conditions was achieved based on calculation results. Crystal growth succeeded via chemical vapor transport (CVT) in a temperature gradient of 973 K to 773 K on YSZ substrates. Single crystal sheets of high crystallinity with heights ≤30 nm were obtained via pure CVT. The crystal properties were characterized by means of optical and electron microscopy, AFM, SAED, micro-Raman and XPS proving their composition, morphology, crystallinity and phase-purity. A highlight of our study is the successful individualization of nanocrystals and the delamination of nanosheets on YSZ substrates down to the monolayer limit (≤1 nm) which was realized by means of substrate exfoliation and ultrasonication in a very reproducible way. },

@article{Mashhadi2018,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 American Chemical Society. The small gap semiconductor $\alpha$-RuCl 3 has emerged as a promising candidate for quantum spin liquid materials. Thus far, Raman spectroscopy, neutron scattering, and magnetization measurements have provided valuable hints for collective spin behavior in $\alpha$-RuCl 3 bulk crystals. However, the goal of implementing $\alpha$-RuCl 3 into spintronic devices would strongly benefit from the possibility of electrically probing these phenomena. To address this, we first investigated nanoflakes of $\alpha$-RuCl 3 by Raman spectroscopy and observed similar behavior as in the case of the bulk material, including the signatures of possible fractionalized excitations. In complementary experiments, we investigated the electrical charge transport properties of individual $\alpha$-RuCl 3 nanoflakes in the temperature range between 120 and 290 K. The observed temperature-dependent electrical resistivity is consistent with variable range hopping behavior and exhibits a transition at about 180 K, close to the onset temperature observed in our Raman measurements. In conjunction with the established relation between structure and magnetism in the bulk, we interpret this transition to coincide with the emergence of fractionalized excitations due to the Kitaev interactions in the nanoflakes. Compared to the bulk samples, the transition temperature of the underlying structural change is larger in the nanoflakes. This difference is tentatively attributed to the dimensionality of the nanoflakes as well as the formation of stacking faults during mechanical exfoliation. The demonstrated devices open up novel perspectives toward manipulating the Kitaev-phase in $\alpha$-RuCl 3 via electrical means.},

Transport on thin flakes of RuCl3 shows VRH with a separate low temperature and high temperature regime, with T0 corresponding to about 50 and about 130 meV respectively. Suggest transition occurs as a result of structural transition. VRH power law dependence confirms 2D nature of flakes.

Their minimum flake thickness is 10 nm.

Raman spectra measured for a bulk and a 10 nm flake are equivalent.

Equations in this paper suggest using fits to the VRH model to learn about the density of states at the fermi level.

Our phonon Raman spectra give evidence for a first-order structural transition from a monoclinic to a rhombohedral structure for both compounds. Significantly, only $\alpha$-RuCl 3 features a large thermal hysteresis, consistent with the formation of a wide phase of coexistence. In the related temperature interval of 70–170 K, we observe a hysteretic behavior of magnetic excitations as well. The stronger magnetic response in the rhombohedral compared to the monoclinic phase evidences a coupling between the crystallographic structure and low-energy magnetic response. Our results demonstrate that the Kitaev magnetism concomitant with fractionalized excitations is susceptible to small variations of bonding geometry.},

The 4d system $\alpha$-RuCl 3 has recently come into view as a candidate Kitaev system, with evidence for unusual spin excitations in magnetic scattering experiments. We apply a combination of optical spectroscopy and Raman scattering to study the electronic structure of this material. Our measurements reveal a series of orbital excitations involving localized total angular momentum states of the Ru ion, implying that strong spin-orbit coupling and electron-electron interactions coexist in this material. Analysis of these features allows us to estimate the spin-orbit coupling strength, as well as other parameters describing the local electronic structure, revealing a well-defined hierarchy of energy scales within the Ru d states. By comparing our experimental results with density functional theory calculations, we also clarify the overall features of the optical response. Our results demonstrate that $\alpha$-RuCl 3 is an ideal material system to study spin-orbit coupled magnetism on the honeycomb lattice.},

We show, exactly, that the true around state of this system must be fully ordered, but simulations only reach partially ordered states because there are infinite energy barriers separating these from the true ground state. We also show that the true ground state of our model of dysprosium titanate is also fully ordered, and offer some explanations as to why simulations and experiments show icelike behavior. We discuss the effect on these systems of an applied magnetic field. Finally, we discuss several other models which show similar partial or full ordering in their ground states, including the well-known Ising model on the fee lattice.},
