We have also added new sections on chemical and phase equilibrium, and expanded our discussions of correlations and scattering, quantized fields, finite-size effects and the fluctuation-dissipation theorem.

abstract = {There are only two ways for solid-state phase transitions to be compliant with thermodynamics: emerging of infinitesimal quantity of the new phase, or infinitesimal "qualitative" change occurring uniformly throughout the bulk at a time. The suggested theories of phase transitions are checked here for that compliance and in historical perspective. While introducing the theory of "continuous" second-order phase transitions, L. Landau claimed that they "may also exist" along with the majority of first order phase transitions, the latter being "discontinuous", displaying "jumps" of their physical properties; the fundamental differences between the two types were specified. But his theoretical successors disregarded these irreconcilable differences, incorrectly presenting all phase transitions as a cooperative phenomenon treatable by statistical mechanics. In the meantime, evidence has been mounted that all phase transitions have a nucleation-and-growth mechanism, thus making the above classification unneeded.},

@article{Cao2016,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 American Physical Society. Single crystals of the Kitaev spin-liquid candidate $\alpha$-RuCl3 have been studied to determine the low-temperature bulk properties, the structure, and the magnetic ground state. Refinements of x-ray diffraction data show that the low-temperature crystal structure is described by space group C2/m with a nearly perfect honeycomb lattice exhibiting less than 0.2{\%} in-plane distortion. The as-grown single crystals exhibit only one sharp magnetic transition at TN=7 K. The magnetic order below this temperature exhibits a propagation vector of k=(0,1,1/3), which coincides with a three-layer stacking of the C2/m unit cells. Magnetic transitions at higher temperatures up to 14 K can be introduced by deformations of the crystal that result in regions in the crystal with a two-layer stacking sequence. The best-fit symmetry-allowed magnetic structure of the as-grown crystals shows that the spins lie in the ac plane, with a zigzag configuration in each honeycomb layer. The three-layer repeat out-of-plane structure can be refined as a 120° spiral order or a collinear structure with a spin direction of 35° away from the a axis. The collinear spin configuration yields a slightly better fit and also is physically preferred. The average ordered moment in either structure is less than 0.45(5) $\mu$B per Ru3+ ion.},

abstract = { This work demonstrates an elegant way to synthesize $\alpha$-RuCl 3 nanosheets down to the monolayer limit by chemical vapor transport and subsequent delamination techniques.  The 2D layered honeycomb magnet $\alpha$-ruthenium( iii ) chloride ($\alpha$-RuCl 3 ) is a promising candidate to realize a Kitaev spin model. As alteration of physical properties on the nanoscale is additionally intended, new synthesis approaches to obtain phase pure $\alpha$-RuCl 3 nanocrystals have been audited. Thermodynamic simulations of occurring gas phase equilibria were performed and optimization of synthesis conditions was achieved based on calculation results. Crystal growth succeeded via chemical vapor transport (CVT) in a temperature gradient of 973 K to 773 K on YSZ substrates. Single crystal sheets of high crystallinity with heights ≤30 nm were obtained via pure CVT. The crystal properties were characterized by means of optical and electron microscopy, AFM, SAED, micro-Raman and XPS proving their composition, morphology, crystallinity and phase-purity. A highlight of our study is the successful individualization of nanocrystals and the delamination of nanosheets on YSZ substrates down to the monolayer limit (≤1 nm) which was realized by means of substrate exfoliation and ultrasonication in a very reproducible way. },

@article{Mashhadi2018,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 American Chemical Society. The small gap semiconductor $\alpha$-RuCl 3 has emerged as a promising candidate for quantum spin liquid materials. Thus far, Raman spectroscopy, neutron scattering, and magnetization measurements have provided valuable hints for collective spin behavior in $\alpha$-RuCl 3 bulk crystals. However, the goal of implementing $\alpha$-RuCl 3 into spintronic devices would strongly benefit from the possibility of electrically probing these phenomena. To address this, we first investigated nanoflakes of $\alpha$-RuCl 3 by Raman spectroscopy and observed similar behavior as in the case of the bulk material, including the signatures of possible fractionalized excitations. In complementary experiments, we investigated the electrical charge transport properties of individual $\alpha$-RuCl 3 nanoflakes in the temperature range between 120 and 290 K. The observed temperature-dependent electrical resistivity is consistent with variable range hopping behavior and exhibits a transition at about 180 K, close to the onset temperature observed in our Raman measurements. In conjunction with the established relation between structure and magnetism in the bulk, we interpret this transition to coincide with the emergence of fractionalized excitations due to the Kitaev interactions in the nanoflakes. Compared to the bulk samples, the transition temperature of the underlying structural change is larger in the nanoflakes. This difference is tentatively attributed to the dimensionality of the nanoflakes as well as the formation of stacking faults during mechanical exfoliation. The demonstrated devices open up novel perspectives toward manipulating the Kitaev-phase in $\alpha$-RuCl 3 via electrical means.},

Transport on thin flakes of RuCl3 shows VRH with a separate low temperature and high temperature regime, with T0 corresponding to about 50 and about 130 meV respectively. Suggest transition occurs as a result of structural transition. VRH power law dependence confirms 2D nature of flakes.

Their minimum flake thickness is 10 nm.

Raman spectra measured for a bulk and a 10 nm flake are equivalent.

Equations in this paper suggest using fits to the VRH model to learn about the density of states at the fermi level.

abstract = {Raman scattering has been employed to investigate lattice and magnetic excitations of the honeycomb Kitaev material $\alpha$-RuCl 3 and its Heisenberg counterpart CrCl 3 . Our phonon Raman spectra give evidence for a first-order structural transition from a monoclinic to a rhombohedral structure for both compounds. Significantly, only $\alpha$-RuCl 3 features a large thermal hysteresis, consistent with the formation of a wide phase of coexistence. In the related temperature interval of 70–170 K, we observe a hysteretic behavior of magnetic excitations as well. The stronger magnetic response in the rhombohedral compared to the monoclinic phase evidences a coupling between the crystallographic structure and low-energy magnetic response. Our results demonstrate that the Kitaev magnetism concomitant with fractionalized excitations is susceptible to small variations of bonding geometry.},

The 4d system $\alpha$-RuCl 3 has recently come into view as a candidate Kitaev system, with evidence for unusual spin excitations in magnetic scattering experiments. We apply a combination of optical spectroscopy and Raman scattering to study the electronic structure of this material. Our measurements reveal a series of orbital excitations involving localized total angular momentum states of the Ru ion, implying that strong spin-orbit coupling and electron-electron interactions coexist in this material. Analysis of these features allows us to estimate the spin-orbit coupling strength, as well as other parameters describing the local electronic structure, revealing a well-defined hierarchy of energy scales within the Ru d states. By comparing our experimental results with density functional theory calculations, we also clarify the overall features of the optical response.

As we have earlier observed, holmium titanate does not display icelike behavior at low temperatures because the long-ranged dipolar interactions between spins are strong compared to the nearest-neighbor interactions. We show, exactly, that the true around state of this system must be fully ordered, but simulations only reach partially ordered states because there are infinite energy barriers separating these from the true ground state. We also show that the true ground state of our model of dysprosium titanate is also fully ordered, and offer some explanations as to why simulations and experiments show icelike behavior. We discuss the effect on these systems of an applied magnetic field. Finally, we discuss several other models which show similar partial or full ordering in their ground states, including the well-known Ising model on the fee lattice.},
