@book{Pathria2011,
abstract = {This classic text, first published in 1972, is designed for graduate physics courses in statistical mechanics. The second edition, published in 1996, incorporated three comprehensive chapters on phase transitions and critical phenomena. This third edition includes new sections on Bose-Einstein condensation and degenerate Fermi behavior of ultracold atomic gases, and two new chapters on computer simulation methods and the thermodynamics of the early universe. We have also added new sections on chemical and phase equilibrium, and expanded our discussions of correlations and scattering, quantized fields, finite-size effects and the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. We hope this new edition will continue to provide new generations of students with a solid training in the methods of statistical physics.-Bose-Einstein condensation in atomic gases -Thermodynamics of the early universe -Computer simulations: Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics -Correlation functions and scattering -Fluctuation-dissipation theorem and the dynamical structure factor -Chemical equilibrium -Exact solution of the two-dimensional Ising model for finite systems -Degenerate atomic Fermi gases -Exact solutions of one-dimensional fluid models -Interactions in ultracold Bose and Fermi gases -Brownian motion of anisotropic particles and harmonic oscillators},

@article{Siddharthan2001,
abstract = {We take another look at two compounds which have been discussed as possible realizations of "spin ice," namely holmium titanate and dysprosium titanate. As we have earlier observed, holmium titanate does not display icelike behavior at low temperatures because the long-ranged dipolar interactions between spins are strong compared to the nearest-neighbor interactions. We show, exactly, that the true around state of this system must be fully ordered, but simulations only reach partially ordered states because there are infinite energy barriers separating these from the true ground state. We also show that the true ground state of our model of dysprosium titanate is also fully ordered, and offer some explanations as to why simulations and experiments show icelike behavior. We discuss the effect on these systems of an applied magnetic field. Finally, we discuss several other models which show similar partial or full ordering in their ground states, including the well-known Ising model on the fee lattice.},
