\chapter{Properties of $\alpha$-Ruthenium Trichloride}
This is a deep dive, cover Hamiltonian, previous experiments, structure, symmetries, phonons, maybe even solve Kitaev spin liquid

\section{Synthesis and Crystal Structure}

Discuss synthesis from beta-RuCl3. Discuss monoclinic to rhombohedral transition.

\section{Electronic Structure}

Discuss evidence that RuCl3 is a Mott insulator. Show plots of calculated electronic structure.

\section{Magnetic Properties}

Discuss magnetic transitions - paramagnet to antiferromagnet. Stacking faults causing additional magnetic transitions.

\section{\rucl as a Kitaev Spin Liquid}

\subsection{The Kitaev Model}

Discuss and solve the Kitaev model.

\subsection{Spin Liquid Behavior in \rucl}

Measurements that show \rucl is a proximate Kitaev spin liquid: neutron scattering, field-induced disordered states, half-quantized thermal hall conductance, magnetic impurity doping suppressing AF interaction.
