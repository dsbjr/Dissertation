\chapter{Electronic Transport}
This chapter describes original measurements of the resistivity of bulk and exfoliated single-crystal \rucl as a function of temperature and electrolyte gate voltage. Bulk measurements are found to correspond with published literature, while measurements of the exfoliated flakes suggest an anomalously high energy density of states at the Fermi level and show substantial hysteresis in resistance when sweeping the electrolyte gate voltage. I conclude by discussing some explanations for the unusual behavior of the exfoliated flakes.

\section{Introduction to Electronic Transport Measurements}

Electronic transport measurements characterize the movement of charge through a material by looking for changes in resistivity as a function of some tuned parameter, like temperature, gate voltage, or magnetic field. Because the resistivity is a empirical consequence of both the electronic structure of and scattering processes in a material, changes in resistivity as a function of the tuned parameter provide valuable information about these aspects.
