\chapter{Electronic Transport}
This chapter describes original measurements of the resistivity of bulk and exfoliated single-crystal \rucl as a function of temperature and electrolyte gate voltage. Bulk measurements are found to correspond with published literature, while measurements of the exfoliated flakes suggest an anomalously high energy density of states at the Fermi level and show substantial hysteresis in resistance when sweeping the electrolyte gate voltage. I conclude by discussing some explanations for the unusual behavior of the exfoliated flakes.

\section{Introduction to Electronic Transport Measurements}

Electronic transport measurements characterize the movement of charge through a material by looking for changes in resistivity as a function of some tuned parameter, like temperature, carrier density, or magnetic field. Because the resistivity is a empirical consequence of both the electronic structure of and scattering processes in a material, changes in resistivity as a function of the tuned parameter provide valuable information about these aspects.

We can learn about the electronic structure of a material by measuring the thermal activation energy of conduction. Consider a material with its electrochemical potential in the band gap. Because there are no partially occupied bands, the material is an insulator. However, insulators do conduct electricity - in order to do so, a carrier must be thermally excited to the bottom of the conduction band\footnote{Put plainly, a phonon scatters from an electron, increasing its energy so that it now occupies a state in the conduction band.}. From Drude theory \cite{Ashcroft1976}, we know that $\sigma \propto n$, where $n$ is the density of thermally excited electrons. We can write the probability of exciting an electron as a Boltzmann factor:

\begin{equation}
\mathbb{P}[\text{exc.}] \propto e^{-\frac{\Delta}{kT}}
\end{equation}

where $k$ is the Boltzmann constant and $\Delta = E_{c} - \mu$. Using the proportionality,

\begin{equation}
\sigma = A e^{-\frac{\Delta}{kT}}
\end{equation}

which is the Arrhenius relation. The value of $\Delta$ extracted from a resistance-temperature curve is the separation in energy space between the chemical potential and the bottom of the conduction band. Changes in $\Delta$ as a function of carrier density contain information about the electronic density of states.


\section{Measurements of \texorpdfstring{\rucl}{RuCl3}bulk crystals}

\subsubsection{Methods}
Single crystals of bulk \rucl were separated into thin layers approximately 3 mm x 3 mm x 100 $\mu$m using sharp tweezers. Individual layers were mounted on a 5 mm x 5 mm x 500 $\mu$m chip of 300 nm SiO\textsubscript{2} on n\textsuperscript{++} Si using a small amount of H20E Epotek conductive epoxy at each of four corners. Electrical contact to the chip carrier was made using gold wirebonding wire and the conductive epoxy mounts. The epoxy was cured at 100\degree C for 30 minutes. The sample was measured in vacuum in a custom cryostat using a DC current bias from a Keithley 2400 source measurement unit. Temperature was measured using an on-chip thermometer. Sheet resistance, and subsequently resistivity, were caj	lculated using 8 different van der Pauw current and voltage measurements to remove any geometric effects.

Hall measurements were not reproducible between magnetic field sweeps because of the small Hall angle $\theta = \tan^{-1} \left( \frac{\sigma_{xy}}{\sigma_{xx}} \right)$ and are therefore not reported.

\end{centering}

Figure \ref{fig:ElecTransBulk-01} presents resistance-temperature curves for two bulk \rucl samples. The thermal activation energy, while different between the samples, remains roughly consistent with published literature. The values of resistivity near room temperature ($\rho \approx 10^{3}$ $\Omega$-cm) are also consistent with published literature.

While Hall measurements are not available for these samples, the consistency with published results for resistivity and thermal activation energy suggests these samples are similar to previously measured samples. Most likely, these samples of \rucl show band conduction with majority electron carriers.

\section{Measurements of exfoliated \texorpdfstring{\rucl}{RuCl3}crystals}

\subsubsection{Methods}
\rucl was exfoliated onto 5 mm x 5mm x 500 $\mu$m chips of 300 nm SiO\textsubscript{2} on degenerately doped Si using a standard scotch tape method; measured \rucl flakes were between 3 and 100 nm thick. A large, coplanar gate, bond pads, and ohmic contacts were defined using either optical or electron beam lithography. Low power argon plasma was used to clean the surface before depositing 5 nm of Ti and 100 nm of Au were deposited using electron beam evaporation under high vacuum.

Samples were mounted on a 32-contact ceramic chip carrier using poly(methyl methacrylate). Gold wirebonds connected the sample to the chip carrier, which was installed in a cryostat. A drop of electrolyte that covered only the coplanar gate and the \rucl flake was manually applied using a pipette tip. The sample and electrolyted were exposed at high vacuum overnight to remove water from the electrolyte. During gating measurements, the electrolyte was biased using a Keithley 2400 source measurement unit in voltage source mode. Applied gate voltage and resulting gate current were recorded during the measurement. Device resistance was also measured by a Keithley 2400 source measurement unit supplying a DC voltage excitation. Temperature was measured using an on-chip resistive thermometer.

  \label{fig:ElecTransExf-01}
\end{centering}

Figure \ref{fig:ElecTransExf-01} presents resistance-temperature curves for exfoliated \rucl samples (without electrolyte). Resistivity is simply activated, and the thermal activation energy remains roughly consistent with my previous measurement of bulk \rucl and with published literature. However, the resistivity between the bulk and exfoliated samples differs by a factor of order $10^3$. The resistivity for bulk and exfoliated \rucl that I have measured is consistent with what has been reported before (compare \cite{Rojas1983} to \cite{Mashhadi2018}), but I have not seen any comment on this difference in the literature.

An obvious explanation is that activated conduction in \rucl is dominated by the surface, and therefore thicker samples seem to have higher resistivity. It is hard to draw this conclusion from the data on hand, as some thicker exfoliated samples are less resistive than thinner samples. However, minor inaccuracies in length, width, and thickness measurements in both the bulk and exfoliated samples may explain the trend. With the data on hand, I can only conclude that the resistivity changes between the bulk and exfoliated samples and may be due to surface conduction or something in the exfoliation process.

\subsubsection{Thermal activation}

\begin{centering}

  \captionsetup{width=0.75\textwidth}
  \captionof{figure}[Exfoliated \rucl activation energy vs electrolyte gate voltage]{Thermal activation energy of exfoliated \rucl samples as a function of electrolyte gate voltage averaged across four different gate sweeps. For points without error bars, the error is smaller than the size of the point. Despite a substantial applied gate voltage, the activation energy changes by less than 10\% of the ungated value.} 
  \label{fig:ElecTransExf-02}
\end{centering}

As seen in Figure \ref{fig:ElecTransExf-02}, the activation energy changes by at most 20 meV from its original value as a function of electrolyte gate voltage. Assuming that the electrolyte accumulates $10^{14}$ \percmsq{} carriers at the edge of the electrochemical stability window, we can estimate the density of states at the Fermi energy as:

\begin{equation}
g(E) = \frac{n}{d \Delta E} = \frac{10^{14}\, \text{\percmsq}}{(100\, \text{nm})(20\, \text{meV})} = \text{5 x 10}^{20}\; \text{eV}^{-1} \cdot \text{cm}^{-3}
\end{equation}

This number is surprisingly large, given that \rucl remains insulating.
