This chapter covers all the transport measurements.

\section{Introduction to Electronic Transport Measurements}

What are transport measurements? What do they tell you?

\subsection{AC Transport Measurements}

How does a Lock-in amplifier work?

\subsection{DC Transport Measurements}

What to do when you can't use a Lock-in.

\section{\texorpdfstring{\rucl}{RuCl3} Bulk Crystals}

Initial measurements of Bulk \ruclnospace . Also Weary Heart.

\section{Exfoliated \texorpdfstring{\rucl}{RuCl3} Crystals}

Use data from Rookle02, Rookle03, Rookle09 (I think the contacts were good for these samples) and then RuCl3TransportSample006
