\chapter{Electrolyte Gating}
This chapter is about electrolyte gating

\section{Introduction to Electronic Structure}

A few introductory words

\subsection{Density of States}

Derive density of states in 1, 2, and 3 dimensions

\subsection{Occupation Function and Charge Density}

Introduce Fermi and Bose occupation functions. Show they reduce to Boltzmann occupation at high temperature.

Introduce Fermi Energy.

\subsection{Electrochemical Potential and Field-Effect Gating}

Extend Fermi energy to non-zero temperature and field.

\section{Gating using Electrolytes}

\subsection{Mechanism of Electrolyte Gating}

Describe how it works with a few graphics

\subsection{Properties and Use of Electrolytes}

What kinds of different electrolytes are available? Why use a particular one? What do you need to think about when doing a measurement?

\subsection{Notable Electrolyte Gating Measurements}

Ambipolar gating of WS2. MoS2 metal-insulator transition. Trevor Petach's measurements.
