% for a variety of reasons this is an all in one document; however,
% when actually doing the thesis it is strongly recommended that each
% chapter be in a separate file and use \include to include in the
% main file.

%% the \beforepreface command produces the title page
%% in the online version it skips the copyright (page 2) and signature (page 3) pages 
%% in the non-online version these would be included
    \beforepreface


%% Abstract can be any number of pages
    \prefacesection{Abstract}
        The abstract goes here.

%% one can also have a prefacesection that is a Preface instead of
%% Acknowledgements.   The thematic purpose is the same (thanks).
    \prefacesection{Acknowledgements}
        Here is where I thank people and include some quotes.

%% afterpreface produces a table of contents and any other tables
%% wanted. At the end pagenumbering changes from roman to arabic and
%% is restarted
