    \prefacesection{Abstract}
A quantum spin liquid (QSL) is an exotic phase of matter identified by interacting spins that do not develop long-range magnetic order down to T = 0 K. QSLs have topological order and are therefore relevant to storing and processing quantum information. Additionally, hole-doped QSLs may be related to high temperature superconductivity, making the study of this phase relevant to a broad section of condensed matter physics.

Recently, the two-dimensional material and spin-assisted Mott insulator $\alpha$-ruthenium (III) chloride (\ruclnospace) has attracted research interest because of its relationship to spin liquids. Localized electrons in \rucl have anisotropic Ising interactions that are described by the Kitaev model â€“ a theoretical type of spin liquid that is exactly solvable. The low-temperature antiferromagnetic order in \rucl can be suppressed by an in-plane magnetic field to create a field-induced QSL, identifying \rucl as a proximate Kitaev spin liquid.

Because \rucl is both a proximate Kitaev spin liquid and a Mott insulator, charge doping may create interesting electronic phases. Previous attempts to chemically dope \rucl have been unsuccessful. However, previously used doping techniques either disordered the lattice or added an unmeasured amount of charge, making this negative result hard to interpret. Charge doping by electrolyte biasing would eliminate these problems, and improve on previous measurements.

I use electronic transport measurements and Raman spectroscopy under electrolyte bias to show that, upon doping, \rucl undergoes a first order phase transition with only small changes in conductivity. X-ray diffraction of electrolyte-biased \rucl rules out intercalation being the cause of this phase transition, and confirms the assumption that electrochemical interactions are negligible. I conclude that this phase transition prevents \rucl from being used to study doped spin liquid physics and suggest further measurements to characterize the newly identified phase.
