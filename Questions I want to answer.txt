Questions I plan on answering

What is a Mott insulator?

How much do you need to dope a mott insulator before it becomes conducting?

Are all QSLs Mott insulators?

Where do the quantum fluctuations that make RuCl3 a spin liquid come from? Do all spin 1/2 systems fluctuate like a spin liquid, or is it something special?

Do spin ices have topological order?
