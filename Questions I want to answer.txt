Questions I plan on answering

What is a Mott insulator?

How much do you need to dope a mott insulator before it becomes conducting?

Are all QSLs Mott insulators?

Where do the quantum fluctuations that make RuCl3 a spin liquid come from? Do all spin 1/2 systems fluctuate like a spin liquid, or is it something special?

Do spin ices have topological order?

Given you only have a small temperature range (100 K), how confident are you in your activation energy measurements?

What is the density of states at the Fermi Energy? Use change in activation energy to set a bound.

What is the screening length in this material?

Given the high effective density of states, where are the carriers going?

Is mystery peak broadening sensitive to gating (for intercalated samples)?

How do changes in Raman mode with intercalation correlate with the expected motion of the atoms in each mode?

For the capacitance fit for transients, how much does error in the fit affect the calculation of the double-layer capacitance?
