Giving a good presentation (ted talk style)

Make it a story.

You as the presenter are a mentor like yoda. The presentation is Luke Skywalker.

Possible structure.

Intro: 10 minutes
-Phases of matter (solid liquid gas)
-Transitions & symmetry breaking, mention first order transitions and hysteresis
-Local order parameter
-Non-locality & topological order (as a way of robustly storing information, use rope & knots analogy)
-How spin liquids realize toplogical order
-Path to superconductivity

Middle: 25 minutes
RuCl3
-How RuCl3 realizes a spin liquid
-Evidence for a spin liquid state in RuCl3
-Previous doping experiments
-Introduce electrolyte gating

Transport
-Brief band structure discussion
-Lack of change in activation energy implies huge density of states at fermi energy
-Hysteresis suggests phase change
-Lay out hypothesis of phase change, intercalation, chemistry

Raman
-Brief discussion of technique
-Two types of spectra and hysteresis between them
-Consistent with phase transition but can't rule out inercalation or chemistry

X-rays
-Brief discussion of technique
-Interlayer separation doesn't change
-Rules out intercalation and minimizes chemistry

Conclusion: 5 minutes
-Phase transition exists without only small changes, no metallization or superconductivity
-Future work (detailed x-rays, polarization measurements, monolayer hBN)
-Look toward more structurally robust candidates (like iridates w/ big spin orbit coupling?) to get the job done?

Backup slides:
-How much charge are you adding?
-What about other x-ray diffraction peaks?
-What about stress in flakes?
-How much charge do you need to add to see metallization?
-How did you do the background subtraction?
-What about herbertsmithite and other spin liquids?
-Slide on RuCl3 electronic structure
-Slide on RuCl3 info (structure, hamiltonian, approximate values, phases, temperatures)
